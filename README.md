The Unicode Security Toolset is a collection of utilities aimed at simplifying the process of analyzing, editing, and visualizing Unicode characters. This toolset is particularly useful for developers working with text encoding, Unicode vulnerabilities, or those interested in character manipulation techniques like spoofing and crash testing.
This project is to showcases my knowledge and to be useful for developers and enthusiasts working with Unicode.

## Features

- **The Unseen Side of Text**: An online tool to display, edit, and insert invisible characters, breaks, confusables and text indicators. Designed for detecting and experimenting with selection logic, emojis, homographic spoofing and normalization.
- **Crash Char Sequence Generator**: Generate a crash making character combination. Try this at your own risk.
- **URL Twister**: Enter a URL to generate random tricky spoofing versions. Would you be fooled?
- **Was This Your Text?**: Enter your corrupted text and maybe we can find how it happened. Is one of them your original?
- **Dr. Unicode**: A heuristic utility for detecting and diagnosing common string corruptions, encoding issues, and alterations.
- **Encoded Prompt Injection Generator**: Explore how encoded inputs can trick AI systems.
